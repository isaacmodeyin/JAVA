Here is a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

This program defines a class called `HelloWorld` with a single method called `main`. The `main` method is the entry point of the program, and it simply prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console using the `System.out.println` method.
